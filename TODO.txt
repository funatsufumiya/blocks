Features:
- Collision
- Lighting
- Noise
- Transparency
  - Parallel sort on GPU via compute shader?
  - OIT?

Bug Fixes:
- Transparent water doesn't appear when toggling blocks in the UI
- UV sampling sometimes bleeding into neighboring blocks
  - Precision issue?
  - Driver bug?
- When window size is zero or hidden, stop drawing
  - There's actually a crash right now because sometimes it causes a
    depth buffer recreate with a size of zero

Potential Database Race:
- If you write to the database queue, then unload and reload the chunk
  before the queue flushes the write, the chunk won't load the changes
- To fix
  1. Make database writes synchronous
  2. Mark dirty chunk positions
     - When the dirty chunk position is referenced for a read, the
       database has to flush it's queue before reading into the chunk
  3. Search through the database jobs on reads for any block writes
- NOTE: While it's possible, I've never reproduced it myself
