Features:
- Collision
- Lighting
- Noise
- Transparency
  - Sorting within chunks
    - Probably need to increase job queue size for a new sort job

Memory Optimizations
- Chunk Paging
  - Kinda an obvious one. Free empty chunks

Bug Fixes
- Had to increase the near plane to avoid depth precision issues but now
  it's clipping into the raycast
  - Add support for changing the camera z planes

Potential Database Race:
- If you write to the database queue, then unload and reload the chunk
  before the queue flushes the write, the chunk won't load the changes
- To fix
  1. Make database writes synchronous
  2. Mark dirty chunk positions
     - When the dirty chunk position is referenced for a read, the
       database has to flush it's queue before reading into the chunk
  3. Search through the database jobs on reads for any block writes
- NOTE: While it's possible, I've never reproduced it myself
