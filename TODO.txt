Potential Race Condition with Database:
- If you write to the database queue, then unload and reload the chunk
  before the queue flushes the write, the chunk won't load the changes
- To fix
  1. Make database writes synchronous
  2. Mark dirty chunk positions
     - When the dirty chunk position is referenced for a read, the
       database has to flush it's queue before reading into the chunk
  3. Search through the database jobs on reads for any block writes
- NOTE: While it's possible, I've never reproduced it myself
